  "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe White House slammed a mob of anti-ICE agitators who reportedly stormed into a Twin Cities church Sunday, accusing local left-wing leaders — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — of inciting the chaos.\n\n\"There is no low these radical leftists won’t stoop to,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital Monday morning. \"Jacob Frey and Tim Walz have whipped these rioters into a frenzy and turned them loose to wreak havoc on Minneapolis.\"\n\n\"Frey and Walz should be ashamed for inciting such chaos, but the Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law,\" she added.\n\nJackson was reacting to a mob comprised of dozens of agitators allegedly storming into the Cities Church sanctuary in St. Paul on Sunday midway through church services, throwing worship into chaos, Fox Digital previously reported. Protesters claimed the pastor was a local ICE official.\n\nVIRAL VIDEO SHOWS ICE AGENT TELLING AGITATORS THEY'RE DISRUPTING ARREST OF CHILD SEX OFFENDER IN MINNESOTA\n\nDepartment of Justice officials vowed Sunday to open an investigation into the disruption, specifically probing for federal civil rights violations \"by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshipers,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi added in a statement Sunday that \"attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law.\"\n\nVideo footage of the church protests spreading on social media does not show local police on the scene deterring the chaos.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department Monday for comment on the matter, and was redirected to the St. Paul Police Department as the church is located within that department's jurisdiction. Fox Digital reached out to the St. Paul police department Monday morning and has yet to receive a reply.\n\nICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS\n\nChaos has broken out in Minneapolis in recent weeks as agitators take to the streets to protest federal law enforcement officials. Federal officers converged on the state in early January as a sweeping fraud case came to light, which has led to dozens of arrests, mostly including members of Minneapolis' large Somali population.\n\nProtests and criticisms against ICE heightened Jan. 7, when a federal officer fatally shot protester Renee Good. Federal officials say Good used her car as a weapon against the agent, arguing he acted in self-defense when he fired his weapon.\n\nDemocrats and administration officials have called the shooting a \"murder\" as they speak out against the administration's deportation efforts of illegal immigrants.\n\nACTING ICE DIRECTOR DEFENDS AGENCY'S FOCUS ON TARGETING CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, DETAILS THREAT TO AGENTS\n\nFrey rejected the Trump administration’s characterization of the immigration crackdown in Minnesota during a Sunday appearance on CBS’ \"Face the Nation,\" claiming the surge of federal agents has made residents feel targeted rather than protected.\n\n\"This is not about safety. What this is about is coming into our city by the thousands and terrorizing people simply because they're Latino or Somali,\" Frey said. \"People in Minneapolis are speaking up. They're speaking up peacefully. They're standing up for their neighbors. And this is not just about resisting Trump. This is about loving and caring for the people that call this city home. And it's been inspiring.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the mayor's office and governor's office for comment Monday morning regarding the White House's statement regarding the church disruption but did not immediately receive replies.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS POSTS ANTI-ICE VIDEO PROMOTING 'PEACEFUL PROTEST' AND UNITY\n\nThe mob converging on a church comes as the Department of Homeland Security has warned that violence targeting ICE personnel has spiked in recent months. In a late November Homeland Security release, the agency said it logged 238 assaults on ICE law enforcement officers from Jan. 21, 2025, through Nov. 21, 2025, compared with 19 assaults during the same span in 2024 — a 1,153% increase.\n\nFallout from Minnesota’s sprawling fraud scandal bled into the state’s political turmoil earlier in January, when Walz announced he would not seek re-election — a decision that came amid intensifying scrutiny of oversight failures during his tenure. Walz, who has served as governor since 2019, acknowledged the wrongdoing occurred on his watch and said state systems failed to catch it sooner, while arguing Republicans were inflating and \"sensationalizing\"\n\nFrey, when asked about the scandal earlier in January, said \"everybody could have done more\" to stop the fraud, but cautioned against blaming broader communities for the alleged crimes of individuals — a point he made while pushing back on rhetoric that has focused on the Somali American community.\n\nMINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD PLACED ON STANDBY TO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT AS PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pinned blame on Democrats and their rhetoric for heightened threats against federal immigration law enforcement officers.\n\n\"The Democrat Party has demeaned these individuals,\" Leavitt said Thursday of federal immigration officers. \"They've even referred to them as ‘Nazis’ and as ‘the Gestapo.’ And that is absolutely leading to the violence we're seeing in the streets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If you look at some of the images out of Minneapolis last night, look at this vehicle, look at what it says,\" Leavitt added. \"It says, ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger, proudly so, at the camera, another ICE individual, a vehicle that was vandalized last night by these left-wing agitators.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom contributed to this article.",
